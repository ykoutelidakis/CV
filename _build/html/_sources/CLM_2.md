# Regulatory Requirement 

## Common Dataset

- Regulatory frameworks are being aligned to mandate for  Net Zero, in conjunction  with a number of international public and private bodies – like the [NGFS](https://www.ngfs.net/en), [GFANZ](https://www.gfanzero.com/) and [TCFD](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/). 

- The NGFS is ensuring that regulators deploy  a global framework for pricing climate risk that is adapted to local jurisdictions.  The framework provides a common starting point and a common understanding of measurement, standards and transparency.

- Regulatory mandates require participants  to size and price the climate risk based on the NGFS framework – through the use of  scenarios and modelling,  requiring data not currently consumed and used within capital markets’ BAU.   

- These data relating to [Physical Risk](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2019/a-framework-for-assessing-financial-impacts-of-physical-climate-change) (natural hazard datasets) and [Transition Risk](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/climate-change-what-are-the-risks-to-financial-stability) (Emissions, Energy  Mix and Prices etc) need to be integrated with Financial and Macro Data  already consumed.  

- The market is standardizing its approach through climate stress test  scenarios. Pricing of climate risk will become part of BAU. For the market to grow there must be a common, golden standard of data – similarly to how [IHS Markit](https://ihsmarkit.com/index.html) provided for the nascent CDS market.
          
## Gaps & Solutions

- One of the key challenges in enabling participations to solve new regulatory requirements is the availability of climate modelling data that can be easily mapped to existing  economic data and modelling techniques.

- Gaps  exist  as  industry standard data providers focus  on ESG benchmarks and indices, while specialist providers of physical and transition data do not provide this   in a consolidated format that can be mapped to economic model inputs.

- Banks aim to use existing infrastructure. In order to use the existing modelling infrastructure this Data will need to  come in the form of both traditional macro-economic / financial datasets and novel physical / transition climate datasets.

- This is the one key issue which needs to be resolved to address the regulatory mandate
