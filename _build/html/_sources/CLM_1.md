## Regulatory Climate Stress Tests

- **Why?** Climate change creates risks to both the safety and soundness of individual firms and to the stability of the financial system. These risks are now  starting to crystallize, forcing regulators to attempt to mitigate.

- **When?** To avoid lasting societal and economic damage the world needs to rewire and decarbonize  – by 2050. The investment requirement for this  transition is enormous, $100 to $150 trillion over the next 30 years.

- **How?** To achieve this transition, markets will be regulated and mandated to direct and support the allocation of capital towards building a Net Zero economy. This will be done, initially, via Climate Change Scenario Stress Tests driving a correct estimation of risks and returns. 

- **Who?** Climate Risk is not priced into  existing Credit, Market and Operational risk frameworks and needs to be a part of BAU. Regulators require Banks and Non Bank participants to price climate risk. ESG  indices and scores do not address regulatory mandate or price risk. 

- Local regulatory mandates, coordinated via the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) address this need,  through requiring banks and insurers to stress tress portfolios against climate risk. The data for these stress tests is not available in an manner which can currently be consumed by the target market
